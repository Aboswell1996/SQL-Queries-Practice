I decided to factor the museum guides and technicians into a broader relation called Employees since both jobs are a type of employee and they will both have similar fields such as salary and personal info. 
I included a unique identifier employee Id that can be used to join with other tables with more specific jobs to get more information about those specific jobs. Therefore, I also created tables 
for more specific info about the technicians or museum guides.

I chose the social security number to be unique and not null, since every employee must have one
for things like health care, taxes, personal info and information like that. Employee is unique because every
employee needs to be identifiable in order to retrieve information about them.
I also made the Ministry of Culture Test Number unique because I wanted every test to be documented and all information
about a specific test to be easily retrieved.
Similarly, the artifacts table has a primary key artifactNumber that is unique so information about specific artifacts
can easily be retrieved and ever artifact is uniquely identifiable. This also helps with finding all tests associated with the artifacts.

I added constraints that the dimensions and humidity of the artifacts be >= 0, since negative values don't make any sense.
I also added constraints for the id numbers and SSN to be positive and nonzero because you can't have an ID of zero or negative. However I made the salary just >= 0 because 
maybe some employees are volunteers or on a temporary trial basis so they would have 0 wage but it can't be negative.
